* All tex files go here.
* Each section should be in a separate tex file. Be modular.
* Figures should be put in `tex/fig/` directory.
* Reference bib files should be put in `tex/ref/` directory.
  * The `main.bib` is auto-generated by `compile.sh`. 
* The main files in this template
  * `main.tex`
    * Modify `title`, `author`, etc 
  * `compile.sh` if you compile tex locally.
    * Modify the var `OUT_FNAME` as necessary
  * `zsupport/`: contains supporting files, including the [style file](https://github.com/ctrlcsui/mrl25/blob/main/scribes/template/tex/zsupport/scribe.sty)
